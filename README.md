Hi! I'm your first Markdown file in **StackEdit**. If you want to learn about StackEdit, you can read me. If you want to play with Markdown, you can edit me. If you have finished with me, you can just create new files by opening the **file explorer** on the left corner of the navigation bar.

This software is a proof of concept using **React** (with material ui, redux, redux thunk, react router) and **aspnet core** web api (version 2) using **Docker** and docker-compose.


## How to run

You need the latest version (tested on version 18) to run.

1. Open the terminal or bash and type
2. Go to project folder and type:

```bash
docker-compose build && docker-compose up
```
